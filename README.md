Where The Fuck / Singapore / Eat

Simple web app to show a bunch of distributed clueless fucks where they should eat, in Singapore.
## Stack
We're using Tornado because Ben thinks 'Go is disgusting' and Cedric twitches
uncontrollably when Node is mentioned.

## Setup
1. Clone the fucking repo.
2. Install `leveldb` by running `brew install leveldb`
3. Install the fucking requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3b. For OS X users, if plyvel fails to compile due to being unable to find `leveldb.h`, you need to install the Apple CLI Tools, `xcode-select --install`.
4. `python main.py`
